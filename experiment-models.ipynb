    "I decided to use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Since this approach builds outputs based on previously retrieved document, and the reponse's most important aspect is the text quality and relevance, I validate the output quality with regard to three metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faithfulness: What proportion of the claims are correct matches (answer/context), when compared to the number of total claims? The closest to 1, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer Relevancy: Asks the model to generate N questions relative to the generated answer. Posteriorly we calculate the average cosine similarity between the generated answer and the \"artificial questions\". The closest to 1, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic Quality: Manual validation to rank the responses according to their fitness to the ground truth\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunking approach that best performs on the examples will the chosen as the final solution."
